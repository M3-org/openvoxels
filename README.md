## Motivation

- Virtual worlds are ephemeral
- Preserving virtual worlds has unique challenges
- Remember the pioneers of the metaverse

I want our digital wonders to last, and the early founders and pioneers of this space remembered. Without history, society is easily reprogrammed by its incumbents. If we donâ€™t tell our story, someone else will. We shouldn't rely on centralized platforms to preserve our digital artifacts and stand the test of time. Twitter is powerful, but it's also a rapid stream. It's useful for data in transit, but not for data at rest.

## Datasets

**Historical snapshots**

Part of the openvoxels mission seeks to preserve, curate, augment, and promote historical digital artifacts from the metaverse. We are planning to take another 3D snapshot of the world on the 3rd anniversary of the last one, 12-13-2022, and run a buildathon alongside such. Join the [discord](https://discord.gg/m3org) if interested.
