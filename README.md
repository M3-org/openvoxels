# openvoxels

Metaverse interop group focused on [Voxels (formally Cryptovoxels)](https://voxels.com/) and voxel art. Come say hi in our discord if interested in topics like open source, 3D graphics, AI, VR/AR, gaming, crypto - we frequently host events across different virtual worlds.

## Motivation

- Virtual worlds are ephemeral
- Preserving virtual worlds has unique challenges
- Remember the pioneers of the metaverse

I want our digital wonders to last, and the early founders and pioneers of this space remembered. Without history, society is easily reprogrammed by its incumbents. If we donâ€™t tell our story, someone else will. We shouldn't rely on centralized platforms to preserve our digital artifacts and stand the test of time. Twitter is powerful, but it's also a rapid stream. It's useful for data in transit, but not for data at rest.

## Avatars

The mannequin avatars Voxels uses is a great placeholder metaphor for custom humanoid avatars, and ironically the only curvy thing in the blocky world of Origin City islands. This repo contains the original files from Voxels that were converted into VRM and FBX to experiment with avatar interop
